`weathertext` is a short Python script that prints current weather information gathered from NOAA, Yahoo!, and/or Google via the [`pywapi`][1] library. It primary intent is to be called by [GeekTool][2] to display the information on the Mac desktop.

A longer description of the goals of `weathertext` and its use of `pywapi` can be found in [this blog post][3].
